        and I developed this game as a learning exercise for using javascript
        and React. I am currently in the process of trying to pivot my career
        from aerospace engineering to software engineering and have been using
        projects such as this one to expand and finetune my skills. Developing
        Jingle Snake has been rewarding as it was my first time using javascript
        and React, but also as an avid gamer it has been really fun getting to
        create a game of my own for the first time. Thanks for checking out my
        project, I hope you enjoyed playing Jingle Snake!
